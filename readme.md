# Rop Shellcode
This is the first lab for my Advanced RE class. Topics included buffer overflow, ROP, and writing shellcode. The shellcode I wrote create a reverse TCP shell to a local server. The requirement was that you have to write code by hand so it cannot be generated by a tool like metasploit.
